# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the first 970 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).  
Each problem includes multiple approaches, mathematical proofs, and tests to ensure correctness.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to solve **all 970 problems** from **Project Euler** using **Python**.  
For each problem, the project provides:

- **Multiple approaches**: Explore both brute force and optimized solutions.
- **Mathematical proofs**: Validate solutions with formal reasoning using LaTeX.
- **Unit tests and property-based tests**: Ensure the correctness and robustness of solutions.
- **Jupyter notebooks**: Explore solutions interactively and document thought processes.

This project not only focuses on solving the problems but also aims to practice **software development best practices**, including:

- Code quality through **linting** with `Python-TA`.
- Automated testing with **GitHub Actions**.
- Use of **version control** with `git`.

Each problemâ€™s folder includes:
- **Solution scripts**: With different approaches to the problem.
- **Tests**: Unit and property-based tests for correctness.
- **Mathematical proof**: A formal proof of the solution using LaTeX.
- **Notebook**: An interactive environment for exploring the solution.
