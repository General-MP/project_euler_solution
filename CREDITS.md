## Author
This solution to the Project Euler problems is created by **Phonlakrit Tiraratn (MP)**,  
a first-year student planning to **double major in Computer Science and Economics**.  
MP embarked on the challenge to solve all 970 Project Euler problems, using multiple approaches and tools for each problem.
